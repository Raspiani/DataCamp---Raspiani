Exercise
Extract RGB values from image
There are broadly three steps to find the dominant colors in an image:

Extract RGB values into three lists.
Perform k-means clustering on scaled RGB values.
Display the colors of cluster centers.
To extract RGB values, we use the imread() function of the image class of matplotlib. Empty lists, r, g and b have been initialized.

For the purpose of finding dominant colors, we will be using the following image.

Import image class of matplotlib.
Read the image using the imread() function and print the dimensions of the resultant matrix.
Store the values for the three colors from all pixels in lists r, g and b.

# Import image class of matplotlib
import matplotlib.image as img

# Read batman image and print dimensions
batman_image = img.imread('batman.jpg')
print(batman_image.shape)

# Store RGB values of all pixels in lists r, g and b
for row in batman_image:
    for temp_r, temp_g, temp_b in row:
        r.append(temp_r)
        g.append(temp_g)
        b.append(temp_b)

Exercise
How many dominant colors?
We have loaded the following image using the imread() function of the image class of matplotlib.



The RGB values are stored in a data frame, batman_df. The RGB values have been standardized used the whiten() function, stored in columns, scaled_red, scaled_blue and scaled_green.

Construct an elbow plot with the data frame. How many dominant colors are present?

Create a list of distortions based on each value in num_clusters by running the kmeans() function.
Create a data frame elbow_plot with the lists: num_clusters and distortions.
Plot the data with seaborn's .lineplot() method with num_clusters on the x-axis and distortions on the y-axis.

distortions = []
num_clusters = range(1, 7)

# Create a list of distortions from the kmeans function
for i in num_clusters:
    cluster_centers, distortion = kmeans(batman_df[['scaled_red', 'scaled_blue', 'scaled_green']], i)
    distortions.append(distortion)

# Create a data frame with two lists, num_clusters and distortions
elbow_plot = pd.DataFrame({'num_clusters' : num_clusters,
    'distortions':distortions
})

# Create a line plot of num_clusters and distortions
sns.lineplot(x='num_clusters', y='distortions', data = elbow_plot)
plt.xticks(num_clusters)
plt.show()

Exercise
Display dominant colors
We have loaded the following image using the imread() function of the image class of matplotlib.



To display the dominant colors, convert the colors of the cluster centers to their raw values and then converted them to the range of 0-1, using the following formula: converted_pixel = standardized_pixel * pixel_std / 255

The RGB values are stored in a data frame, batman_df. The scaled RGB values are stored in columns, scaled_red, scaled_blue and scaled_green. The cluster centers are stored in the variable cluster_centers, which were generated using the kmeans() function with three clusters.

Get standard deviations of each color from the data frame and store it in r_std, g_std, b_std.
For each cluster center, convert the standardized RGB values to scaled values in the range of 0-1.
Display the colors of the cluster centers.

# Get standard deviations of each color
r_std, g_std, b_std = batman_df[['red', 'green', 'blue']].std()

for cluster_center in cluster_centers:
    scaled_r, scaled_g, scaled_b = cluster_center
    # Convert each standardized value to scaled value
    colors.append((
        scaled_r * r_std / 255,
        scaled_g * g_std / 255,

Exercise
TF-IDF of movie plots
Let us use the plots of randomly selected movies to perform document clustering on. Before performing clustering on documents, they need to be cleaned of any unwanted noise (such as special characters and stop words) and converted into a sparse matrix through TF-IDF of the documents.

Use the TfidfVectorizer class to perform the TF-IDF of movie plots stored in the list plots. The remove_noise() function is available to use as a tokenizer in the TfidfVectorizer class. The .fit_transform() method fits the data into the TfidfVectorizer objects and then generates the TF-IDF sparse matrix.

Note: It takes a few seconds to run the .fit_transform() method.

Instructions
100 XP
Import TfidfVectorizer class from sklearn.
Initialize the TfidfVectorizer class with minimum and maximum frequencies of 0.1 and 0.75, and 50 maximum features.
Use the fit_transform() method on the initialized TfidfVectorizer class with the list plots.

# Import TfidfVectorizer class from sklearn
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize TfidfVectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_df = 0.75, min_df = 0.1, max_features = 50, tokenizer = remove_noise)

# Use the .fit_transform() method on the list plots
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(plots)

Exercise
Top terms in movie clusters
Now that you have created a sparse matrix, generate cluster centers and print the top three terms in each cluster. Use the .todense() method to convert the sparse matrix, tfidf_matrix to a normal matrix for the kmeans() function to process. Then, use the .get_feature_names() method to get a list of terms in the tfidf_vectorizer object. The zip() function in Python joins two lists.

The tfidf_vectorizer object and sparse matrix, tfidf_matrix, from the previous have been retained in this exercise. kmeans has been imported from SciPy.

With a higher number of data points, the clusters formed would be defined more clearly. However, this requires some computational power, making it difficult to accomplish in an exercise here.

Exercise
Basic checks on clusters
In the FIFA 18 dataset, we have concentrated on defenders in previous exercises. Let us try to focus on attacking attributes of a player. Pace (pac), Dribbling (dri) and Shooting (sho) are features that are present in attack minded players. In this exercise, k-means clustering has already been applied on the data using the scaled values of these three attributes. Try some basic checks on the clusters so formed.

The data is stored in a Pandas data frame, fifa. The scaled column names are present in a list scaled_features. The cluster labels are stored in the cluster_labels column. Recall the .count() and .mean() methods in Pandas help you find the number of observations and mean of observations in a data frame.

Exercise
FIFA 18: what makes a complete player?
The overall level of a player in FIFA 18 is defined by six characteristics: pace (pac), shooting (sho), passing (pas), dribbling (dri), defending (def), physical (phy).

Here is a sample card:

Eden Hazard Player Card

In this exercise, you will use all six characteristics to create clusters. The data for this exercise is stored in a Pandas dataframe, fifa. features is the list of these column names and scaled_features is the list of columns which contains their scaled values.
