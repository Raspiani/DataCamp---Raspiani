Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
Create arrays X and y for the features and the target variable. Here this has been done for you. Note the use of .drop() to drop the target variable 'party' from the feature array X as well as the use of the .values attribute to ensure X and y are NumPy arrays. Without using .values, X and y are a DataFrame and Series respectively; the scikit-learn API will accept them in this form also as long as they are of the right shape.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier called knn with 6 neighbors by specifying the n_neighbors parameter.
Fit the classifier to the data using the .fit() method.

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)

Create arrays for the features and the target variable from df. As a reminder, the target variable is 'party'.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier with 6 neighbors.
Fit the classifier to the data.
Predict the labels of the training data, X.
Predict the label of the new data point X_new.

# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors: knn
knn =KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)

# Predict the labels for the training data X
y_pred = knn.predict(X)

# Predict and print the label for the new data point X_new
new_prediction = knn.predict(X_new)
print("Prediction: {}".format(new_prediction))
